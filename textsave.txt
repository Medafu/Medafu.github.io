Hi reader, my name is Vlad, I'm 18 years old and I live in Ukraine now. Pretty shy
and introverted. Main hobbies are games and music. More about them below.

Games

Games is my oldest and still biggest hobby. I willing to try everything, could it be AAA or just an indie game,
but unfortunately i don't have a powerful pc for all new AAA games. I don't really like RPG's overall, but
I can try them from time to time, even now I have King's Bounty installed. I mostly like games with focus on
gameplay rather than
story, though you will see a bit lower that I have some short story games as my favourites. Recently started
playing a lot of Grand Strategy games released by Paradox.

Music

I discovered the love for music only in 2018-2019 by finding Metallica. Since then
I began to take an interest in band's biography and musical history overall.
For some reason music manages to entertain me more than films or anime and I personally
find it more interesting.
